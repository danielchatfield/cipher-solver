Charlie, this is dynamite. Turing was one of the top codebreakers in the war and he seems to have uncovered some huge conspiracy going back years. I read on in his notebook and discovered the following: 

"Porta's cipher was rather obviously detected since the musical notation employed resulted in music that, to anyone with any knowledge, was obviously artificial. Thicknesse's variation led to music that was somewhat more plausible to the untrained eye and would have passed muster at the sort of inspections likely to be given at borders. Historically Tempest seem to have used a variant on these schemes, which has gained in sophistication over time and seems to have allowed them to communicate with impunity for over one hundred years." 

It is pretty clear that he was on to something with Tempest, but it is not clear why his research was hidden up on the roof. Maybe he was scared that they were on to him. I wouldn't want some ancient assassination cult chasing me just because they heard we were on to them, either! Guess we should keep our eyes open! (Just kidding).
