Tempest agents: Action at once 

Further tracking of texts and emails in Southern Central region confirms active investigation into Tempest. The Turing papers have been found and the operatives appear to be students at a location in the vicinity of Bletchley Park. Tempest analysis of stored internet traffic from the same sources suggests that they acted previously under the name: The Night Climbing Club. 

Surveillance and housekeeping teams in Southern Central to mount detailed Tempest tracking and to triangulate on traffic sources. London Region to mount full Tempest tracking of security and police agencies and to report any apparent contact with the Night Climbing Club members. 

Standing orders remain that no contact is to be made without direct clearance from my office. Preparations should be made to eliminate the threat, but no action should be taken without central authorisation. It appears that the operators are young amateurs and, given the lack of sophistication in their security, it may be difficult to discern how far the Tempest papers have leaked, preventing a suitably quiet termination of the threat.
