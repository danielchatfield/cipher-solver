OK, I took a look at that notebook you sent over. I can see why it was so well hidden. Whoever wrote it hadn't bothered encrypting it securely at all, so I don't think it can originally have been official work. On the other hand given the talk about the war, and given the location I have a feeling I know who AMT might have been. There was a night climbing club at Cambridge back in the 30's, so maybe that was how AMT got the idea of hiding things up on the roof at Bletchley. Clearly he was worried about Tempest and, if AMT was who I think it was, then it will definitely be worth trying to find out more. 

I looked at the next bit in the book, and it is clear that he was in a hurry; the encryption isn't a lot harder to crack in that either. I guess, with security so tight back then, he wasn't worried about anyone reading the notebook. They would have assumed it was work related and would know better than to pry. On the other hand he clearly didn't want anyone stumbling on it by accident so he wrote this part up in an affine shift cipher. It would be a lot harder to crack without the word structure. 

Anyway, it is clear that AMT believed that Tempest were still active in the forties and that they were involved in assassination attempts for a while before that. I am not sure how they were supposed to profit from that, but maybe if we read on we will find out. Funny how they seem to have used music notation in their ciphers. I wonder how. Maybe there is something about it later in the book. Was there anything else in the packet you found?
