Mark, I told my Grandma all about the Tempest Conspiracy. Did you know she used to work in the security services? She said she had never heard of it, but she has a friend she called Harry (probably not his real name!) who is still on the edges of that community, and she reckoned he might be able to help. She also asked some people at her old place to keep an eye out for us and watch for anything unusual. They took my computer in for analysis to see if they could find any more info about the hacker. In the meantime I have been working more on the Turing papers and reading some old newspapers, trying to pick up any trail left by Tempest. I figured I should look for big shifts in stock prices moved by historic events, but there are quite a few of those as you might expect. But then I thought some more about Turing's remarks concerning their use of intelligence and began to wonder what he meant when he said: "they invented their own distribution network, smuggling secrets across the world in music manuscripts using steganography". Steganography is the art of hiding a message, so I figure the encryption was disguised, but it was the word "smuggled" that got me. What would be the best way to hide the music manuscript? Seems risky to me: Grandma Charlie remembered a case in New York in the Fifties when a gambling syndicate tried to disguise a Porta Cipher in musical notation, but got caught when a cop who played piano noticed how odd the music looked. I figured that Tempest are too clever to risk that, but Grandma reminded me about the story "The Purloined Letter". Remember what Dupin said? "Perhaps the mystery is a little too plain". I think I may know how they did it. 

More later, 

Charlie
