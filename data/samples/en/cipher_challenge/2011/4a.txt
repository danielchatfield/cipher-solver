Mark, you are probably wondering why this is a handwritten letter. It's alright I haven't turned my back on the digital age, but you know you said we should keep our eyes open? I have a nasty feeling you might have been right. It seems like someone has been reading my mail. You know how we set up that web bug system to protect Night Climbing meets? Well, someone in France has triggered it. I wouldn't have noticed because they had wiped it, but I lost a bunch of music when the disc died and was in the process of restoring from a hidden backup partition when I noticed the disc on the server was slow. Someone was crawling through the files sending them to somewhere in dotfr. They were wiping their trace as they went but I caught part of the traffic and figured out where they had been. There was a small gap in the access record that told me where to look. Normally I would put it down to a Hungarian hacker, but this was too slick an operation and they seemed to be hunting for stuff. They only looked at files with words starting T. Sound familiar? 

I am really spooked. I keep thinking I am being followed and I hear funny noises on my phone. I must be imagining it. How can a story from nineteen forty something be of any interest now? 

Anyway I have set up some traps to watch all our communications for leaks. I think we had better do everything by hand from now on. No spreadsheets, no phones, nothing electronic. Just drop letters through the door. Real oldstyle. I know this makes encryption hard, but I think it is more important than ever. We should tighten up. Maybe use one of those old keyword ciphers next time. What do you think?
