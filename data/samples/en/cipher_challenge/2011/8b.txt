Tempest Executive Report: Hurricane Warning 

Further leaks from London Intelligence suggest that the British Government is protecting the young agents Charlie and Mark. They are scheduled to leave London on flight CO19 bound for Newark on Friday 16th December, but no through booking is on record. New York agents have been instructed to watch all air traffic on that date. It is likely that the agents will be processed through back channels at the airport so to ensure proper monitoring we have activated airside sleeper agents at Newark and JFK. 

The situation in European markets is leaving our London and Frankfurt operations very little room for profit taking without further destabilising the Euro. Our Wall Street Operations Centre is, if anything, too successful, leveraging the situation through several highly geared investments in hedge funds and credit default swaps. The risk here is that we will force the closure of another major institution like Lehman Brothers, drawing unwanted attention to our position. It will be necessary to conduct an orderly dismantling of our European position to prevent embarrassing publicity. 

Important cost savings will be achieved by simultaneously scaling back security and intelligence operations in Europe. These savings will be invested in counter intelligence operations aimed at destabilising the ongoing investigation of our operations by European and American intelligence agencies. 

Tempest has a habit of surviving, if not thriving, in difficult situations. and, with our flexible approach to ethics and investment we are perhaps the organisation best placed to prevail in the current climate.
