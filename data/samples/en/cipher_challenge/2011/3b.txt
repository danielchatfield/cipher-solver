Alert all Tempest agents: 

Monitoring stations have picked up chatter in texts and email traffic in which the following keywords are repeated and adjacent: Turing, Tempest, assassination. All stations in the south are to increase resolution on traces and triangulate on sources using these triggers. 

Surveillance and housekeeping teams in Southern Region to standby for immediate action. All leave cancelled. 

In the lead in to the Turing centenary it is still possible that the text adjacencies are coincidental, however the Turing incident was the last time our organisation faced serious threat. We have operated for the last seventy years without discovery and it is essential that we terminate any nascent investigations immediately, and with the highest discretion. 

No contact to be made without direct clearance from my office. All reports Eyes Only, direct to me using Level 2 encryption (keyword substitution or transposition only, blocks of 5, keywords to be taken from the music dictionary as usual.)
