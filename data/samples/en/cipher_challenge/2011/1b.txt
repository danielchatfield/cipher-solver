My discoveries concerning the Tempest Conspiracy have led me to a terrifying conclusion. This is no historic curiosity. The conspiracy is alive and well in the modern world and may, in part, be responsible for this terrible war. They seem to have had a hand in every major conflict in the past 140 years, finding ways to profit from the misery they have inflicted. 

I will try to set out in this notebook all that I have uncovered in the hope that someone will find a way to bring the conspiracy to account for its actions. My initial enquiries were triggered by the discovery of a cipher hidden in the manuscript of Malgoire's "Les Paladins". The cipher itself was truly elementary, but the manner of its concealment in musical notation was unusual and ingenious and piqued my curiosity. On deciphering it I discovered what appeared to be plans for the assassination of Bonaparte, dating from around 1799, and referring to the "Machine Infernale". The papers discussed the profits that might follow from the demonstration of the terrifying effectiveness of the weapon. 

Startling though this find was, the comparison with the terrors of this current war made it seem of merely passing interest. However a further accidental discovery led me to another manuscript from the same period, which also contained detailed plans of another assassination attempt. This time the object of the plot was our own Prime Minister, the Right Honourable Spencer Perceval. His opposition to Bonaparte made him an unlikely target of the same conspirators, and yet the similarity in the method of encryption and concealment of the cipher seemed too much of a coincidence. 

I began to suspect that our conspirators may have had more sinister, more mercenary, objectives and an international organisation. And in this way began my obsession with the Tempest Conspiracy. AMT
