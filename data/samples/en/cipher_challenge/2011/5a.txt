Charlie, I cracked another section of Turing's papers - it was really tricky since he used a keyword substitution cipher, but then he reversed the order of the letters in each five-block. I had to reverse them all myself before I could even start to crack it. If I hadn't guessed it was double encrypted I would never have got it! And it was really long. Next one you get to do! Anyway, I think you are right, Tempest was the first hacking crew in history. And if Turing never closed them down, they could still be active and they could be watching us. I don't know what we should do, who do you contact about something like this? Can we just ring up GCHQ and report it? And what do we report? That we stole a bunch of papers while trespassing on private property? And that they expose a two hundred year old conspiracy? It doesn't sound convincing does it? But what if they are still active? Maybe they are behind all these recent conflicts? Or the banking crisis? Or the problems in Greece? This could be massive. I just had a thought. Did you meet anyone at that University summer school you went to who might be able to help? Wasn't there a Professor Ben something-or-another who was connected with codes? Could you ask him what we should do? Mark
