Guys, we made it up over the roof last night! Hardest yet; getting past the night watch was not easy, but it beats everything we've ever climbed. Can't believe we've done Bletchley! But that's not the most amazing thing. Someone else had been up there before us, and I don't mean recently. When I was crossing the ridges I pulled on a brick in one of the chimneys and it came out in my hand. Thought I was stuffed for a minute, but C grabbed me and we got safe again. Anyway behind the brick there was a packet wrapped in some old cloth and stenciled with one word. I had a quick look inside and found what looks like an old notebook and a bunch of papers. Most of it is in a code so I don't know what its about, but it looks interesting. Here is the first page of the notebook, wondered if any of you could crack it. Anyway, it gave me an idea. We should have a new name for the Night Climbing Club. We could name it after the word on the packet, what do you think? It just says, Tempest.
