Tempest agents: Storm Warning 

Leaks from London Intelligence HQ suggest that British Govt. tracking of Tempest agents and communications has been stepped up in the wake of our Southern activities. It is advisable to reduce all e-comms to a minimum and to bring in currently active personnel. 

The state of play appears to be as follows. Two young people named Charlie and Mark have stumbled across Turing's papers in which he outlined the history of Tempest. They have been tracked electronically and we have deciphered their emails and other communications. They appear to have cracked Turing's encryption, and have a good grasp of the historical role of our organisation, and, alarmingly, have made a link with our more recent financial activities. They do not appear to have understood how changes in international finance have altered our approach, though they have persisted in working through Turing's notes and there is evidence that they have been studying other sources to try to track our activities themselves. They seem to have detected our intrusion into their own network, and are aware that we may be tracking them. We have reason to believe that Charlie has a family connection with the security services, but no firm evidence that our current operations have been compromised. Nevertheless, it is essential that we increase our internal and external state of readiness in case it is necessary to react. 

Given the importance of determining the full degree to which our operations are currently compromised, observations should be maintained, but these should only involve our deepest deep cover agents. Hooke will be taking control of Southern region operations and Central Bursary will provide all necessary resources. No action should be taken until the full level of government interest is known.
