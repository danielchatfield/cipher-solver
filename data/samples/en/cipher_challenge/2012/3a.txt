My dear Charles, 

At your urging I am continuing to decypher my Uncle’s will. His statement that “the danger did not end with the war” is somewhat alarming. Was it his intention to suggest that I am at some risk? Could his actions during the war really be posing a danger to me after all this time? It is clear that we will have to complete the decryption if we are to understand. 

I did not encounter VERONA during the war, and have heard nothing about it during my exile here on Malta, but I think it might be time to make discrete enquiries about it in London. Would you oblige me in this? 

One other thing. Almost certainly I am jumping at shadows, but my landlady remarked that over the last week or so she has noticed two men loitering in the neighbourhood of my apartment. I cannot believe that this is connected with my Uncle’s will, but his warning has alarmed me and I have engaged the assistance of a local detective to keep watch. 

I take your point about securing our communications. Tiberius is clearly more concerned to secure these later sections of the document as well, and I had to work hard to break the keyword cypher he used here. Returning to the wartime convention of five letter blocks really does add to the security of the text, and I had to carry out frequency analysis on this section of the will. I suggest that in the future we too use the wartime convention. I think that with this precaution the affine shift cypher should afford us sufficient security in our letters to one another. 

Yours, 

Nicholas
