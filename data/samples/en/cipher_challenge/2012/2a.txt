My dear Nicholas 

I know how shocking these revelations must have been for you, and given your past experiences no one could blame you for the decision you have made to turn your back on your uncle’s strange request. Nonetheless, while we are still unsure of the purpose of the document I think it would be a mistake to relinquish the task he has set you. 

I must admit that I find it almost impossible to reconcile your current view of Tiberius with the man we both knew, and so I have taken the liberty of deciphering the next chapter of his will myself, in the hope of revealing more information that might help us to understand him better. I know that its contents will not entirely reassure you, but I think you owe it to yourself, if not to Tiberius, to read on. 

In the meantime allow me to share some remarks concerning the will. Throughout my professional life, I have had the misfortune to read a number of final letters written by men driven to self destruction and I must tell you that this has an entirely different feel to it. There is a frankness which suggests that Tiberius is more concerned for the truth to be known than he is to protect his reputation. I have a feeling that Tiberius understood that this would be hard for you, but whether you like it or not I am certain that you will learn the truth if you complete the challenge he has left you. 

You said that we should maintain the greatest discretion, but I am sure Tiberius would remind you that a Caesar shift cypher could not possibly provide you with the degree of security you require. I suggest that you might follow Tiberius’s lead and use something more secure like an affine shift cypher for your reply. 

Yours, 


Charles
