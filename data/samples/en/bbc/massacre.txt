A man imprisoned after being suspected of involvement in a massacre in Africa has been released from jail.

David Simpson, 24, was working in the Central African Republic when he reported coming across 18 bodies, which led to his jailing in March.

Mr Simpson, from North Yorkshire, was now in his employers' compound, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office said.

A spokesman said the case had "not been formally concluded", but it was hoped that situation would change "soon".

It means that despite his release from jail, Mr Simpson is not currently free to travel.

The FCO was in contact with Mr Simpson, his family and the local authorities, he added.

Mr Simpson was working for Swedish company Central African Wildlife Adventures, which takes clients game hunting, and had been looking for a water supply when he said he found the bodies in remote bushland.

He told his family it was believed the suspected massacre had been carried out by the rebel group the Lord's Resistance Army.

After contacting the authorities, the family said Mr Simpson had gone voluntarily to answer questions and was arrested and imprisoned on suspicion of murder.
